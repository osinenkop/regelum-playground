# To adjust system parameters, uncomment the code below

# system_parameters_init: 
#   mass: 0.127
#   grav_const: 9.81
#   length: 0.337

# The logic behind this is as follows. The case system class constructor contains a code
#
#   if system_parameters_init is not None:
#     _pamateres = system_parameters_init
#
# By assigning to `system_parameters_init` in a `yaml` config, we feed the respective paramters to the system
