# This section defines the default configurations for the project
# It includes various components such as policy, system, simulator, scenario, etc.
# Each component is loaded from its respective YAML file
# The ${system} syntax allows for dynamic loading based on the chosen system
# Optional components like agent_calfv are also included
# The agent_calf is specifically needed only when scenario=calfv
# This allows for conditional loading of the CALF agents
# when running the CALFV scenario, while not affecting other scenarios
